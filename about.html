                    <p>It is important to remember that what makes a photo beautiful isn’t just in front of the camera, but also the person behind it. A camera captures a moment in time that is impossible to reproduce, gone forever. However, a photo is how a photographer perceives that moment and how they wish to tell a story without any words. The story they wish to tell is enhanced from their own background. This is my background:
                      <br>
                      I’ve always had a passion for creativity and innovation. Ever since I was young, I was constantly curious how thing worked and why they worked that way. This crave for creativity helped me try new things such as taking food recipes from online and adding my own spin to them, or writing computer programs to automatically open a garage door. 
                      <br>
                      My imagination is what led me to photography. I will admit, it took me some time to realize invisible passion I had for photos. When people would ask to me to take photos of themselves, they would find that my photos were the most sound to what they were looking for in a picture. So, as the go-to photographer, I would never object to taking photos. But, as I continued taking photos of people, my innovative side would kick in. I would try to enhance their planned photos by playing the subjects in different locations, finding a perfect angle, or messing with the saturation… and people loved it. The photos I would take started to surpass people’s original expectations.
                      <br>
                      This was when I realized why photography would best suit me: it allowed for me to be myself and try new things. I slowly shifted from taking photos of people on an iPhone and pushed my comfort zone a little bit. I started experimenting with light, landscapes, and flowers. I took a class at a college which helped me build my skills in Photoshop and Lightroom. Most important of all, I didn’t stop being myself. I would always try to allow my vision lead me to the perfect picture.
                      <br>
                      I am only 16 years old. When some may see this as a drawback, I see it as an advantage. I have so much to learn and still have so much time. I will continue to take inspiration from countless others and notice the magnificence in their stories. I will continue to learn from fellow photographers and take more classes. But most important of all, I will continue to be the innovation person I am and make sure my imagination allows a single click to tell a 1000 words.</p>
